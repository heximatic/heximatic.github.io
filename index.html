    <li>Hello. Here are a few things you might want to know about me:<br>
    ❖ I go by many names, but you may refer to me as Kaleb or Regal.<br>
    ❖ I define myself as a Black, Queer, Autistic individual. These identities are very important for understanding how
    i relate to and interact with the world.<br>
    ❖ At the same time, it is important to understand and recognise the humanity and existence between myself and others. I am not just my identities,
    but I am also human and a wonderful thing that exists, just like everyone and everything. <br>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> ❖ My Philosophy ❖ </p>
    ❖ Know your limits, and respect them. ❖ This is all our first times being alive. ❖ Everything is FLUX! ❖
