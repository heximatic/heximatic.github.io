		❖ I am a being made of love, and a being made of fear, fueled by a desire to be, at the core of it all. <br>
		❖ Call me *Kaleb*, if you must. <br>
		❖ I try my best to recognize all things as being made out of the same essential things as I am, which means
		I have no reason to fear... but things are frightening sometimes regardless. <br>
		❖ Does your way of understanding reality impede upon other people's safety and ability to construct reality
		in thier own way? If so... you are still my brother and sister, but you are also my enemy. <br>
		❖ You let your fear rule you... your need for control, don't... let it consume you. This is how the terrible
		things of the world persist (poverty, war, illness, abuse and so many other things...) <br>
		❖ I am afraid... <br>
