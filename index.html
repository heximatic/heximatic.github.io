			❖ I go by many names, but you may refer to me as <b style="color: rgb(79, 149, 255);">KALEB</b> or <b
			style="color: rgb(255, 238, 0);">REGAL</b>.<br>
			❖ It is important to understand and recognise the humanity and existence between myself and others. I am not
			just my identities,
			but I am also human and a wonderful thing that exists, just like everyone and everything. <br>
			❖ I make art. I think much about my own and other people's minds. I become intensely focused on certain things
			to the point of forgetting my other responsibilities.
			I am human. I am proudly and sadly and excitedly and terribly and distantly and fully human. That's the beauty
			of it, my and everyone's light and shadows.
			Its a delicate balance.<br>
			❖ I would generally be described as Black, Queer, and autistic; these identities are only important in
			understanding how I relate to others socially though,
			and are only an aspect of my existence.<br>
