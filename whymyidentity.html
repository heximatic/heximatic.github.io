I spent much of my tween and teen years feeling very lonely, understandably. I was an autistic queer Black kid transitioning into a primarily white space, growing into my own, and trying to figure out where my place was. I drifted between different social groups, never quite feeling close to anyone except one or two person(s) here or there who I attached myself to desperately.
<br><br>
I had no sense of identity. I sort of tore that apart when I lost contact with... I dunno. Something.
<br><br>
From what I can remember, I didn't have imaginary friends until I was in, like, third or fourth or fifth grade. I guess I wasn't as lonely before, but once I hit double digits, it really started to weigh on me. I remember one instance in fourth grade, I think, standing in the gym, trying to imagine people around me. There were real people in the gym, of course, but I wanted someone who would play with me specifically. Or talk to me. Anything. I remember things in visuals, and so, in that specific memory I have, there are like... 3-5 fuzzy gray faceless figures around me, and I seem to be happy about it. And it started with that.
<br><br>
And then there was TC and Heroteen. I have yet to get out of the habit of... referring to these characters as real people (I don't even know if I want to), so... I think I will refer to them as if I were talking about a person still (its only respectful). 
<br><br>
<i>Another note here: /I/ gave some sense of myself to these characters. A lot of it actually. The me of now is not the me of then, and the me of then wasn't really a /full person/ either. I am shaky on referring to that version of /myself/ as me, and so you will see self-identifying pronouns with slashes.</i>
<br><br>
Heroteen was a mature and older guiding force for /me/, telling /me/ to pay attention in class and to stop thinking about... unpleasant thoughts. TC was a manifestation of /my/ fiery temper, being younger than /me/, and sort of like a little sister. The more /I/ thought about them, the more they seemed real to /me/. /I/ imagined them as companions /I/ took with /me/ on adventures, like skating or to the mall - they walked beside /me/. /I/ talked to them. Through writing and verbally. /I/ desperately wanted them to be real. /I/ made three-foot tall paper doll versions of them and hung them up on my wall and talked to them. /I/ had a dream about the paper doll coming to life and being upset that /I/ abandoned them (/I/ would have to leave them alone during school, after all.) /I/ desperately dreamed that they were real, at least maybe in another universe. 
<br><br>
That did something to my psyche. That messed me up at least a little. /I/ was not only a sad and anxious autistic Black girl, but also I was these characters. I had split my psyche, my sense of self, at least a little.
<br><br>
There were then other manifestations. 'Evil side' was a explanation for my violent and destructive sort of thoughts, and xXHTGXx was the bubbly and playful aspects of my personality. That main part of myself, then, asked why. So there I was, five in total. 
<br><br>
TC and Heroteen laid the groundwork for it, and from there it was so much easier to...
<br><br>
/I/ started hearing voices. I wondered why. I wondered what was wrong with me, why I couldn't fit in. I figured I was crazy or something. I started dissociating, no surprise. /I/ was already depressed and anxious too. 
<br><br>
In sixth grade, /I/ got expelled for threatening to stab someone (I don't remember if I had anything on me or not, but to be fair, /I/ had been causing a lot of issues otherwise). I had to go to therapy or CPS would take me away from my family. I told them what I thought was going on and they diagnosed me with schizophrenia and put me on Abilify. That didn't help. I wasn't... there was a lot going on in my life and //our// symptoms were all a mix of different factors. 
<br><br>
Years later, I think, my second time in the psych ward when I was a freshman in high school, //we// ended up there on /my/ delusion that TC, now Kaleb, was to kill me, oh so upset about her abandonment. (I.. go by that name now...)
<br><br>
//We've// had multiple dissociative episodes, where reality seems to melt away and /I/ forget who I am. Reality just didn't match the internal experience. 
<br><br>
I have somewhat of an identity now. I am Kaleb, a college student studying psychology. I want to know how and why my brain works the way it does//I want to understand how other people's brains work and how they are different than mine. It's a shaky foundation though, and sometimes I see through the cracks. I convince myself that they aren't there. But when I have to confront it, I think of myself like this:
<br><br>
Mask Kaleb/[Deadname] - Mask autistic symptoms and everything else
?? : Cyan (asking the questions of self)<br>
xXHTGXx : Regal (playful, big bright yellow eyes)<br>
TC : Denial Kaleb (get back on track!)<br>
Heroteen : Jacob (everything will be alright)<br>
Evil Side : Rage (::anger::!)<br>
<br><br>
It's weird. But I don't mind it. I spent far too much time arguing with myself about if this was a dissociative issue, but //we// just don't fit in with that sort of framework (a trauma framework, at least)(there's just far too much drama and not enough information within the multiple/plural community!).
