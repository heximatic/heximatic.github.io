<p><em>results-based... how do we present ideas in ways that most people can understand, not just focus on the work?</em></p>

<pre><code>        - Take test <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">time</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, wait, test <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">time</span> <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, correlate scores

    **Internal Consistency**
        - Give people series <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> items <span class="hljs-keyword">at</span> one <span class="hljs-built_in">time</span> point
        - How consistently do they respond?
        - Strength: easy <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> calculate <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> collect data
        - Weakness: can't pick up variance due <span class="hljs-keyword">to</span> <span class="hljs-built_in">time</span> problems
     **Split-half reliability**
        - Instead <span class="hljs-keyword">of</span> creating alternate forms, split test <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> half <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> correlate <span class="hljs-keyword">with</span> itsself

<p><em>Spearman-Brown Prophecy Formula</em>
Mathematical relationship between how long your scale is and how reliable it is - more reliable at a longer scale... how long should I make my test?
(but struggle becomes with interpretation for people who might be ESL or disabled)</p>
<p>Advanced analyses
How many seperate dimensions are there within a specific test?</p>
<h4 id="validity">Validity</h4>
<p>How do we determine validity? 
Criterion-related validity:</p>
<ul>
<li>does it correlate with meaningful non-test criteria? <ul>
<li>Ex. if interviewing for a job, people that score high on a test should have similar test scores in the future</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Predictive<ul>
<li>Happening before the job</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Concurrent<ul>
<li>Not going to have much variation; surveying people who are all fairly similar</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    Does the test correlate with other tests the way the theory would expect?

<h5 id="content-validity">Content Validity</h5>
<p>Does the content of the test match the content of the domain?</p>

<p>On the face of it, do the items look like good items? (a more general content validity, vice versa)</p>

<p>Post-Hoc contrast: 
    After found significant difference in an ANOVA, compare means across to find which groups are significantly different
If alpha error is .05, there is a 5 out of 100 chance that we&#39;ll find differences where there are none</p>
<p>a-priori: planned
