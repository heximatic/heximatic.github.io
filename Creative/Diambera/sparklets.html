<li>(May 6, 2022) My physically written material talks about Sparklets as such;
<br>
<i>Sparklets are the molecular material that allow the islands to float and also
'Sparkles', where the very fabric of reality splits (making a rift) and allows more of the creatures in. The
beings of Diambera, the newest ones, they tend to be more hostile.</i>
<br>
And, taking from my main Google Drive page;
<br>
<i>The Bounce and the Spark are two opposite forces, like gravity and inertia. The spark pulls things
together, not even technically being from the universe, and is most like gravity, while the bounce,
well, causes molecular structure to bounce and dance with each other but never quite combine. Yes.
The spark only happens occasionally.</i></li>

<li>The Spark formed organisms together, much like how things work on earth and in universe 1, which houses
earth. Universe 196 houses Diambera. Different kinds of sparks formed different kinds of materials,
however, it is known to be quite unstable as, once again, from another universe. The spark
provides its own energy, which the Bounce also feeds on, so it's a delicate balance. Basically, if
something dies, it simply falls apart. EX: the skylands. The skylands are dead, but the beings keep
it alive on the surface.
<br>
(I have a bit of a problem of saying 'The Skylands Are Dead' without really emphasizing what that means.
Hopefully more on that later.)
<br>
Anyways, in this idea, Bounce and Spark are the two main forces. (In a way, my current idea isn't too far off from this, with Echomatter having the ability to make
matter bounce). And this theory is just a rebranding of Gravity and Inertia pretty much, but a combination
of Magnetism, where the Spark glues and pulls things together like opposite poles, while the Bounce makes
things fall apart and accellerates them away from eachother.</li>

<li>(Thinking about it, that dosen't sound too bad an idea if
I were to rename the forces to something cooler. What do you think about Nebula Organizer (NO) and Yoke
Ending Subatomic Particle (YES(P))?)</li>
