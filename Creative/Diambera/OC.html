    <h1>Original Characters and thier power</h1>
    <p>We've all come up with ideas for characters. None of them are truly original, of course, but they are also really only yours. So, you craft your own universe in your mind (or at least I do), constantly.</p>
    <p>Trying to craft a whole world really puts things in to perspective. There are trillions, quadrillions of living, reproducing, evolving, breathing, consuming things on this planet. The same would be for anywhere else capable of producing life, out in other planets in solar systems in galaxies. That's... a lot to know. That's a lot to process, that's too much for the human mind to think of all at once.</p>
    <p>So we focus on smaller things. We focus on things we create- our neighborhood, our finances, our families. But we all have our own inward monologues, our inward universes that we are constantly creating and destroying, like the nebulae and gas and dust floating between voids and passing past different stars... there is only so much we can have there, in space and time.</p>
    <p>I have imaginary families and friends. Some I know well. The vast majority, I have never met. In the universe of my mind, I know some beings better than others. I am the one in control of my inner universe, but...</p>
    <p>These characters that I know, they influence me. They influence their creator. That gives them immense power, does it not? They have, more than anyone else, to create and destroy things wildly outside of their comprehension, because they are both me and a part of their own universe.</p>
    <p>So, who like that, of this universe, has that kind of power?</p>
