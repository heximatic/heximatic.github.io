<p><b>Classifications</b></p>

<p>Energy classification is a measure of (mana) how much a being is able to manipulate the matter around them in order to defy physics (magic). 
Most beings have a slight, innate ability which they can train.
These abilities are less likely to work when fully in the line of a grid (Fray Theory), or when closer to the Ult-Cels, 
but they are stronger when one is further away from an Ult-Cel, making the function of magic quite subjective to a planet or solar system. 
It is also important for what happens to an individual’s body or soul when there is a body death.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>M(Mortal)</b></p>
<img src="M.png">
<p>Mana level 0-30, has to reproduce to continue species and dies in the expected timeframe for their species. 
Able to perform magic with the help of charms. Is most typical, or default for most beings, but ratios greatly depend on location. 
Just your average Joe, really. When they die, there is a body death, but their essence(soul) is recycled(reincarnated) into the universe 
until the universe dies or they ascend into a higher classification.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>H-IM(Half-Immortal)</b></p>
<img src="HF-IM.png">
<p>Mana level of 31-100. Tends to live longer than expected for their species, and can still use charms to enhance their magic. 
Power obtained through many different methods, as to be detailed at some vague point in the future. 
(I’m going to have to write a whole book, aren’t I). Probably, like, old wizards? When they die, there is a body death, 
but their essence(soul) is recycled(reincarnated) into the universe until the universe dies or they ascend into a higher classification.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>IM(Immortal)</b></p>
<img src="IM.png">
<p>Mana level of 101-250. These beings tend to be of the undead or demonic/angelic variety (died and revived), 
only really able to survive via the use of magic. Since most, if not all of their energy goes to keeping them alive 
(they have more mana than average but are constantly leaking it), they tend to register as higher levels than they actually 
are able to functionally use. When they die, their body and essence(soul) are permanently dead- their essence is remade in a further universe.</p>
<hr>
<p><b>(ULT-IM)Ultra-Immortal</b></p>
<img src="ULT-IM.png">
<p>Mana level of 251-500. Immensely powerful, often the most powerful individuals seen on any sort of... not even planet, 
but <i>solar system</i>. Can only be killed by being stripped of power by interaction with an Ult-Cel. 
These tend to be ‘angels’ or ageless, timeless furry lookin’ beings. Or NOVAs. They are created when an IM’s essence(soul), 
nearly destroyed, is able to absorb the power of an ULT-CEL and ascend the power level they are at. When their ULT-IM body dies, 
their body is dead and so is their essence; their essence is remade in a different universe. Kinda hope it’d be hard to die in this 
universe if you already died twice.</p>

<p><b>CEL(Celestial)</b></p>
<img src="CEL.png">
<p>Mana level of 501-1000. Beyond ‘immortality’, these beings are few and far between. 
Tend to be forgotten about between Ult-ims and Ult-Cels, but they’re like mini-gods, 
able to exert might over whole galaxies or even galaxy clusters. True powerhouses. 
However, this is also a classification to describe the combined might of several different lower classes, so a magic empire could be 
considered a celestial. Their bodies and souls are unable to be destroyed, and so they will be around until the end of a universe.</p>

<hr>
<p><b>ULT-CEL(Ultra-Celestial)</b></p>
<img src="ULT-CEL.png">
<p>>Mana level of 1000-∞ (he’s over 9000!). Only Gods (with a capital G) hold this name- they are perceivable and theorized to be able to exist. 
However, are they really gods? (Actually, this may be sort of a mythical title for a hypothetical god and not a real thing…)<br />
Anyways, Ult-Cels are so immense in power that they are theorized to have caused, and continue aiding in the function of the universe. 
It is a mystery on if anything this powerful is really able to exist in reality. (In Fray Theory, 
they do exist at the center of each universe and weave it out). They are unable to die-they exist from the very beginning of a universe until the very end.</p>
