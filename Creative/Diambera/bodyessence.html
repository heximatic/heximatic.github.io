<p>Fray theory is a very scientific explanation of how Diambera and Universe 196 operates. But to get a little less
    scientific here and be a little more philosophical, I'm deciding to look back into a concept I sort of just came up
    with but also have been thinking about for a minute (and also didn't really think of this myself because this is a
    philosophical idea and I have been very interested in philosophy as of late; see: <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_forms" target="_blank">theory of forms</a> aaand <a
        href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/AQAL-basics-mapping-of-the-four-quadrants-of-integral-theory-Adapted-from-Esbjoern-Hargens_fig3_327188185"
        target="_blank">the four quadrants</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)"
        target="_blank">integral theory</a>). This is a little less complicated than Fray Theory (I say to myself), but
    I have my work cut out for me on thinking about how to get this to fit in with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Body is the objective nature of things; it is the atoms and elements and all of that. Think of the body that you are
    inhabiting, that you consider to be a representation of yourself. It is outside of one's senses.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Essence, then, is the soul of things. We all look at a mountain and say that that is a mountain, regardless of
    the language it is expressed in or the senses through which it is viewed. It can be removed from its context and
    still be understood as being a mountain, just as you could be removed from your body but still be 'you'. 'You' are
    an ever-changing, shifting thing in flux, but 'you' could still be pointed to and identified as the only thing that
    is exactly 'you'. <br /></p>
<p>In Plato's Theory of Forms, Essences are the pure forms of an idea, thing, or expression, and the things we point to
    through our senses are imperfect representations of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe I could adopt this in some form into Fray Theory, where there are two different kinds of energy to be
    manipulated. The manipulation of 'yu' is 'nan' - there is 'dae' yu and 'fai' yu, dae being body and fai being
    essence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3/10/24, addendum: Thinking about this further, I forgot to include that since there is a finite space of the
    universe, there is a finite amount of yu to be manipulated. fai is not able to be manipulated - the essence of
    things will always remain the same, and dae is able to be manipulated for as long as yu does not change.</p>
<p>So, like, geometry transformations - reflection, rotations, translations (teleportation, maybe?) and scaling
    (shifting?) . Even though the object changes, it is still the same thing, measurably. A being, like a shifter, might
    become bigger or smaller and change their shape as they do so, but they are still, in essence, the same. They have
    always had that ability to change themselves, they were born/made with that ability, but their soul or essence
    (mind? circumstance?) are still the same. For things that are larger, like the Skylands being there... they don't
    move, they have a fixed place in the sky, and the pocket of space that they split from still remains - any debris
    that falls from them gets stuck in mid-air. <br /></p>
