<p>We operate within Frameworks/Models, or ways of understanding the world. We create these things in order to make sense of the noise that the world is.
<br> This is a framework about frameworks.
<br> I tend to use Ken Wilber's AQAL framework to try and think holistically about the world and how I, and the people around me, interact with it.

<ul>
    <p>Question everything. Never stop questioning. <br>
        The moment you begin to feel comfortable in some sort of identity, the moment you begin to say 'oh, well i'm [identity]' is the moment that you have to break it down once again. Why is it that you've said that? What does it even mean to be that thing? And why do you want to identify with it?
        <br>No matter what you do, you will be near constantly reinforcing your identity through your language. "You are, but not me", "because of (my) [identity]...", "I am (a)..." "I am someone/ a person who..." "As a [identity]..." "My [identity] has caused me to..." "I think/feel/need/want..."
        The very thought of being an 'I' is, well, just that; the ego. This is not a bad thing. It is just important to evaluate.</p>

<p>
Traditionalism (sincerity or pre irony): There are truths to the world which can be found through faith in institutions, and if we are able to follow these institutions then things will turn out (pre-enlightened, false spirituality)
<br>Modernism(irony): There are truths to the world that are objective, and which can be found through technology and objective institutions (scientific, high value on the 'It' quadrant). Only certain values should be respected, and certainly not those of the traditionalist. 
<br>Post-Modernism (post-irony): All sorts of people lead all sorts of different lives, so we cannot value just the perspective of the it, the 'objective'. Subjective experiences shapes one's experience of the world, unlike what the Modernist believes. All perspectives must be valued. Truth is an illusion, a social construct. 
<hr>
Meta-Modernism (meta-irony): Well, clearly there is some value to all of these perspectives; we must look beyond the duality here. There are some perspectives which are certainly incorrect, though indeed focusing solely on the institutions as a guiding force is not helpful either. We must collectively integrate, as holons of holons within holons, these different layers of thinking and make sense of them all. (This is difficult at first, hence the multiple layers of the second tier within Ken Wilber's AQAL model).
